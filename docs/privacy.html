  <p>At Unicorn Agency, protecting your privacy is important to us. We want you to understand what information we collect and how we use it. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting the <a href="http://trax.management">website</a> or using the Trax Application, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>What Information We Collect and From Whom We Collect It</h2>

  <p>We may collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:</p>

  <p>Information we receive from you on applications or other forms;</p>
  <p>Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others; and</p>
  <p>Information we receive from non-affiliated third parties, including consumer reporting agencies.</p>

  <p>In addition, we may use "cookies" (small text files transferred from our website to your hard drive) to recognize repeat users, track usage and facilitate your access to and use of the site. We do not use “cookies” to gather personal information and we do not link “cookies” to identifiable information, such as a policy number. The “cookies” only enable you to use our website more easily.</p>

  <p>"Nonpublic personal information" is nonpublic information about you that we obtain in connection with providing a financial product or service to you.</p>

  <h2>Nonaffiliated Third Parties to Whom Disclosures May Be Made</h2>

  <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries that <a href="https://unicornagency.com">Unicorn Agency</a> controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>

  <p>We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you, such as we have described above, to insurance companies, general agencies, and other insurance-related entities that perform marketing services on our behalf or with whom we have joint marketing agreements.</p>

  <p>We may also disclose nonpublic information about you to non-affiliated third parties as permitted by law, such as when required to do so by a court order or subpoena.</p>

  <h2>Our Security Procedures</h2>
  <p>We restrict access to your nonpublic personal information and only allow disclosures to persons and companies as permitted by law to assist in providing products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your nonpublic personal information.</p>

  <h2>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h2>
  <p>If you choose to visit <a href="http://trax.management">website</a> or use the Trax Application, your visit or use and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Utah. If you have any concern about privacy, please send us a thorough description to <a href="mailto:trax@unicornagency.com">trax@unicornagency.com</a> and we will try to resolve it.</p>

  <p>Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also. You should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.</p>
