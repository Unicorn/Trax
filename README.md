This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks. You can find the most recent version of that guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).


## Prerequisites
You'll need at minimum, an [Oauth Token/Secret](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/) from Github, as well as a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). You can drop these in a `.env` file in the project root like so:

```
GH_API_TOKEN=XXX
GH_CLIENT_ID=XXX
GH_CLIENT_SECRET=XXX
```

### Todo

- [ ] Remove prop-types in favor of TS
