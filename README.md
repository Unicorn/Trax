Sometimes waiting for a product that you want and need in your life just doesnâ€™t make sense. Your productivity suffers everyday without it, and hours are lost managing mundane tasks. We recognized the need for such a product when we calculated the debt of operations across our whole team. We had tremendous overhead with collecting hours and invoices from a myriad of contractors and employees. In addition each developer on our team spends at least a couple hours a day navigating github repositories. The complexity of many users, with many repositories, with many tasks.. starts to become a significant cognitive load.
