This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks. You can find the most recent version of that guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).


## Prerequisites
You'll need at minimum, an [App Token and Secret from Github](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/). You can drop these in a `.env` file in the project root like so:

```
GH_CLIENT_ID=XXX
GH_CLIENT_SECRET=XXX
```
