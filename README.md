Sometimes waiting for a product that you want and need in your life just doesnâ€™t make sense. Your productivity suffers everyday without it, and hours are lost managing mundane tasks. We recognized the need for such a product when we calculated the debt of operations across our whole team. We had tremendous overhead with collecting hours and invoices from a myriad of contractors and employees. In addition each developer on our team spends at least a couple hours a day navigating github repositories. The complexity of many users, with many repositories, with many tasks.. starts to become a significant cognitive load.

## Prerequisites
You'll need at minimum, an [Oauth Token/Secret](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/) from Github, as well as a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). You can drop these in a `.env` file in the project root like so:

```
GH_API_TOKEN=XXX
GH_CLIENT_ID=XXX
GH_CLIENT_SECRET=XXX
```

You'll also want the latest versions of Node, NPM, and yarn.

### Install
Installation is pretty straightforward. `yarn setup` will do a `yarn install` and `graphql get-schema` which uses your `GH_API_TOKEN` to fetch the graphql schema from github's api/self-discovery.

```
GH_API_TOKEN=XXX yarn setup
```

## Running the application
`yarn dev` will get everything started up in development, provided you have met the prerequisites. `yarn electron:build` will compile the application for regular use.
